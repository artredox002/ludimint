## Problem

Traditional competitive gaming and tournament platforms face critical barriers that limit accessibility and fairness:

1. **High Transaction Fees**: Existing platforms charge significant fees (often 10-30%), drastically reducing player rewards and making micro-tournaments economically unviable.

2. **Lack of Transparency**: Players cannot verify fair prize distribution or score authenticity. Centralized platforms control all aspects of tournaments without on-chain verification, leading to trust issues.

3. **Geographic Exclusion**: Many platforms exclude users from certain regions due to regulatory restrictions or payment limitations, preventing global participation.

4. **Complex Crypto Onboarding**: Users need extensive blockchain knowledge, multiple wallet setups, and high gas fees to participate, creating barriers for mainstream adoption.

5. **Mobile Accessibility Gap**: Most blockchain gaming platforms are desktop-only or poorly optimized for mobile devices, despite mobile gaming representing over 50% of the global gaming market.

6. **Trust and Security Concerns**: Players must trust centralized platforms to fairly distribute prizes, verify scores, and handle funds securely, with no recourse if platforms act maliciously.

These problems particularly affect users in emerging markets who have limited access to traditional banking but have smartphones and internet connectivity - exactly the demographic Celo and MiniPay aim to serve.

## Solution

LUDIMINT solves these problems through a comprehensive decentralized platform built specifically for Celo and MiniPay:

**1. Decentralized Smart Contract Architecture**
- All tournaments, prize distributions, and score verification run on audited smart contracts deployed on Celo mainnet
- Trustless operations ensure no single entity controls funds or tournament outcomes

- Seamless MiniPay integration enables one-click wallet connection and payments
- Progressive Web App (PWA) optimized for mobile devices, requiring no app store downloads

**3. Fair Play Through Commit-Reveal Pattern**
- Cryptographic commit-reveal mechanism prevents cheating by hiding scores during submission
- Players cannot see others' scores before submitting, ensuring honest competition
- Smart contract automatically verifies score authenticity

**4. Global Accessibility**
- No geographic restrictions - anyone with internet and MiniPay can participate
- Simple onboarding through MiniPay deeplinks - no complex wallet setup required
- Supports multiple Celo tokens (cUSD, cEUR, etc.) for global stablecoin access

**5. Transparent Prize Distribution**
- Automatic, on-chain prize distribution to top-K winners
- Pull-pattern claims reduce gas costs for winners
